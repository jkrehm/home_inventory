## README

The original Home Inventory project can be found at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/homeinv/). The author no longer supports the application, so since I've made some modifications of my own (and have some others that I want to make), I'm posting the project here on GitHub. The vast majority of the code is not mine, so I can take no credit (nor blame) for it. As I make changes and improvements (that's the idea, at least) I'll push them.

### TODO
- Validate user input.
- Change database calls to use PDO (instead of old and insecure MySQL calls).
- Make currency and dates locale specific (based on either configuration or the server's settings).
