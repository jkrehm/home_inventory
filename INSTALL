or features request!

REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- A web server with PHP >= 4.3 installed and properly configured
  I suggest Apache (http://www.apache.org).
  
- MySQL (http://www.mysql.com) with a user account with select, insert,
  update, delete and create privileges

- Smarty template engine (http://smarty.php.net)



INSTALLATION STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: if you are upgrading from a previous installation of home inventory follow the
      appropriate section below.

If you have problem installing or configuring home inventory please submit a
request on sourceforge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/homeinv/, I will reply
as soon as possibile.


FIRST INSTALLATION:
-------------------
1) Untar package in a directory somewhere in your web server hierarchy:
   
   tar jxvf package_name.tar.bz2
   
   I assume this final directory structure:
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/htdocs		<---- web server shoult point here
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty		<---- smarty base directory
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty/templates	<---- .tpl repository
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty/templates_c	<---- compiled .tpl
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty/configs		<---- empty but needed!
   /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty/cache		<---- empty but needed!
   
   so that you can access by typing http://your_server/home_inventory, where you_server
   is your server's host name.
	
2) Run mysql logging in with your administrator account and create 
   the Home inventory's user with the command:

   > GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE on home_inventory.* TO 
	'homeinv'@'localhost' identified by 'your_password';

   Please refer to mysql user manual for further instruction:
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/#manual)

3) Copy and paste the contents of install.sql into MySQL session to create
   needed tables or enter the following command into the bash shell:
   $ mysql -u homeinv -p < install.sql

4) Open /environment.php and edit the following constants with your
   installation path, server hostname, MySQL choosed password, and username/password to
   login into home inventory:

	define('SITE_PATH', '/var/www/localhost/home_inventory/');
	define('SMARTY_DIR', '/usr/share/php/smarty/');		<---- smarty package installation path: depends on your linux distribution or windows
	define('MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME', 'home_inventory');
	define('MYSQL_USER', 'homeinv');
	define('MYSQL_PASSWD', 'your_password');
	define('MYSQL_SERVER_HOSTNAME', 'your_hostname');
	define('HOMEINV_USERNAME', 'username');				<---- user/passwd for home inventory's login
	define('HOMEINV_PASSWD', 'passwd');
	
	Note1: home inventory provide initial login as simple security protection, but for now
	       it's not possible define several user. Perhaps in future release...
	Note2: image attachment is limited to 120 KB (JPG or GIF), if you want to change this size 
		   please edit PICTURE_MAXSIZE costant in htdocs/environment.php

5) Make sure file permissions are correctly set in the directory (directory is
   world readable and executable and files are all world readable, e.g.)

6) Go to http://your_server/home_inventory and enjoy!!



UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSION  ( < 1.2.0)
-------------------------------------------

I assume that home inventory was installed in /var/www/localhost/home_inventory
and that the database name was 'home_inventory'.

1) First backup your previous installation for safety:
	cp -R /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/ /var/www/localhost/home_inventory_OLD/
	
2) Untar package in the same directory of your previous installation:  
   tar jxvf package_name.tar.bz2
   this command updates all files preserving uploaded images.

3) Open /var/www/localhost/home_inventory_OLD/htdocs/environment.php with a text
   editor, then copy and paste all the define() line at the start of the file 
   into the new copy of environment.php (DO NOT copy the whole file!)

4) Upgrade the database structure with the following command into a shell.
   NOTE: An administrator account with ALTER privileges is needed (for example root)
   $ mysql -u root -p < upgrade.sql
   
5) Delete smarty cache:
	rm -f /var/www/localhost/home_inventory/smarty/templates_c/*

6) Go to http://your_server/home_inventory and test the new installation.
   If all is fine delete old directory  /var/www/localhost/home_inventory_OLD/
